# Quantum Group Project

### Readme files

So this is a general readme file, it's usually used for any general comments or information you want others to know about a project. In this case, I'll add a small Git Introduction to the file as a quick reference. If there are any other things we want to add during the project, feel free to make additions to this file!

### Git Introduction

I do appreciate us using GitHub for this project. I'll try to make it as easy and uncomplicated as possible :)

Okay, so Git is a version control system, you should all have that downloaded. GitHub is basically a platform that uses Git and allows for collaboration.

There is only a few features that will be useful during the project:

#### Branches

A branch is basically a snapshot of the code. When you start coding, you create a new branch off of the main branch. Give this branch a name, and then you can make any edits/additions to the code. Think of this branch as "your version" of the code, its your personal place to make changes without anyone else interfering with it. 

In VS Code you make a new branch by clicking on the branch name in the bottom left of your screen. It should show the branch name next to a logo with three circles. If you click on it, a popup should appear at the top of your screen. Simply type out the name of your new branch and hit enter. Now the name of the branch in the bottom left of your screen should reflect that you are working in the new branch you just made!

#### Making Edits

Okay, that sounds cool and all, but how do you actually make and save changes. Well, if I didn't screw things up you should all have this project open in some editor (like VS Code). In this editor you should be able to make all the changes you want. Once you have made all the changes you wanted, or at least want others to be able to see the changes you have made, you can do the following:

In VS Code you should see the logo with the three circles in the left menu on your screen. When you click on this, a "source control" sidebar should appear. To publish your changes back to GitHub, click on the "+" (stage changes) for every file you made edits to. Once you have done this, type a message in the top text field to describe what work you did. Once you have done this, click the big blue "Commit" button. A popup will appear asking you to confirm.

Once all the edits you've made have been commited, you'll see another big blue button labeled "Sync Changes". Click this button (and confirm in another popup) so that all the local edits you made and committed actually get shown on GitHub. 

#### What Now?

So theoretically, that should be all. Once you have clicked "sync", all your changes should be visible on GitHub. However, that does not mean your changes are on the main branch, they are still on your separate branch, its just visible to others now. From here you need to merge the branch into the main branch, which you do by making a pull request on the GitHub site. Click, create a new pull request, then select main as your base branch which should be compared to your branch. You will be prompted for a title and description, feel free to fill those in with as much detail as you want. Then create the pull request, if it says something about a merge conflict don't worry about it, I will fix those and actually merge the branches back into main!

And that should actually be everything we need during the project. If you have any problems or need help, don't hesitate to ask me, I'll try my best to help!
