# Quantum Group Project

### Git Introduction

I do appreciate us using GitHub for this project. I'll try to make it as easy and uncomplicated as possible :)

Okay, so Git is a version control system, you should all have that downloaded. GitHub is basically a platform that uses Git and allows collaboration.

There is only a few features that will be useful during the project:

#### Branches

Think of a branch as a snapshot of the code. When you start coding, you create a new branch off of the main branch. Give this branch a name, and then you can make any edits/additions to the code that you want. Think of this branch as "your version" of the code, its your personal place to make changes without anyone else interfering with it. Once you have made all the edits you wanted to in the branch, it can be merged back into the main branch so all your edits become available to the others.

In VS Code you make a new branch by clicking on the branch name in the bottom left of your screen. It should show the branch name next to a logo with three circles. If you click on it, a popup should appear at the top. Simply type out the name of your new branch and hit enter, that should be all that is necessary.

#### Making Edits

Okay, that sounds cool and all, but how do you actually make and save edits. Well, if I didn't screw things up you should all have this project open in some editor (like VS Code). In this editor you should be able to make all the changes you want.
